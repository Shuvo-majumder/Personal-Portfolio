                <p>HI,

                    I am Shuvo Majumder. My home town is Gazipur. I have passed SSC from Rasulgonj ML High School by obtaining GPA 4.18 in 2017. My high school is also situated in Lakshmipur.
                    
                    After passing SSC, I have got admitted to Lakshmipur govt. College, Lakshmipur and completed HSC in 2019 with GPA 4.00. After a year, I've got admitted to DIU of Fall 2020.
                    
                    After facing different situations, now I have decided to be an AI specialist and in future I want to work for AI, that is my aim. I know there are more difficulties I have to face in future, but I will try my best to overcome those to reach my goal.
                    
                    Thanks.</p>
